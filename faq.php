                           <strong>Q2. I am responsible for doing all the research for my paper?</strong>
                           <li style="text-indent: 30px;"> - Certainly not! If you have previously conducted research and would like it included, just included it with your project information. Otherwise, your writer will conduct all relevant research for you.</li>

                           <li style="text-indent: 30px;"> - Most certainly. All of our writers have graduate and post-graduate degrees in their specific fields. We will assign your project to the available writer who is most qualified</li>
                           <strong>Q5. Is the paper 100% original?</strong>
                           <li style="text-indent: 30px;"> - Yes. When you hire Master Essays, you will always receive a new, original paper, that has been written specifically for you</li>
                           <strong>Q6. Is my personal information safe?</strong>
                           <li style="text-indent: 30px;"> - We value your personal information as much as you do. We will never release your name or information. Our services are 100% confidential</li>
                           <strong>Q7. What if Iâ€™m not happy with the paper?</strong>
