                        Most people think that editing and proofreading are the same. They involve similar techniques, but each takes place at a specific stage in the writing process. Editing is generally something that is done as soon as you have finished the first draft of your paper. An editor will re-read the paper in order to check and verify several things. Editing confirms that the structure and arguments presented in your paper are sound and coherent. It generally involves checking the following aspects of your paper: 1) checking the CONTENT to verify is satisfies the assignment requirements; 2) verifying that the OVERALL STRUCTURE of the paper is academically correct; 3) verifying that the PARAGRAPH STRUCTURE flows properly; 4) ensuring that the CLARITY of your argument and your overall paper is sound; 5) checking the overall STYLE to ensure it is appropriate; and 5) Checking that your CITATIONS are accurate and correctly formatted. <br/><br/>

                        Proofreading is the final stage in the writing process. A good proofreader will ensure that the paper contains no spelling or grammatical errors. These days, most people disregard the proofreading process and rely on their word processing software to do it for them. This can be a huge mistake. Spell checkers regularly confuse words and lack the depth to deal with advanced terminology. Grammar checkers often become confused by complex sentences and they usually have a hard time dealing with tense and syntax issues.  If you’ve already completed the writing and editing process for your paper, you should seriously consider letting an expert from Master Essays proofread the document before you submit it.  <br/><br/>
                        The proofreaders at Master Essays are second to none. They carefully go through each paper they receive several times – checking for one specific type of error during each read-through. Master Essays’ proofreaders slowly pour over every single word to make sure everything is correct. They also verify the flow, grammar, syntax and tense of your paper. Our proofreaders are experts. They have proofed thousands of documents and they understand that it can be a tedious and time consuming process. When you receive your project back from Master Essays, you will be able to rest assured that every word in your paper is correct, and that every punctuation mark has been check and re-checked. <br/><br/>
