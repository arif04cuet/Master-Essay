                        “I work 2 jobs and have a full course load. I just didn’t have the time to complete some of my coursework. Initially, I was worried about the quality of the paper I would receive. I had heard some pretty bad things about online writing services for students. Much to my surprise, the paper I received from Master Essays helped me to get the best grade I had all term. THANKS!” –John MAPoli-Sci<br/><br/>
                        “I was having trouble with the admissions process for my MA program. Master Essays assigned me a writer and he guided me through the entire process. He helped me write my admissions applications, edited my CV, and was even available to answer all of my questions. Master Essays is a great service.” – Natalie 4th year Bio-Chem<br/><br/>
                        “As a foreign student, I sometimes had difficulty getting my ideas across in English while writing assignments. Master Essays has really helped me out. My grades have improved and I don’t fear receiving my papers back from teachers anymore.” – Jin 1st year Economics<br/><br/>
                        “Senior year was very important for me. I understood that I had to get my grades up if I wanted to get into university. I used Master Essays to help me with several of my History and English assignments. My overall average shot up 8% and I got accepted to the program of my choice.” Jake – Gr. 12 student
